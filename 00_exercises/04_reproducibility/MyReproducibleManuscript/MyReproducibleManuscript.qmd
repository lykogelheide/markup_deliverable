## Meet the penguins

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
The `penguins` data from the palmerpenguins package [@penguinsBib] contains size measurements for 
`r nrow(penguins)` penguins from three species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

The plot using the ggplot2 package by @wickham2016data below shows the relationship between flipper and bill lengths of these penguins.

## Results
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
penguins <- read.csv("data.csv")

ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = `Flipper.Length..mm.`, y = `Culmen.Length..mm.`)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Species, shape = Species)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(
    title = "Flipper and Culmen length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for penguins at Palmer Station LTER",
    x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Culmen length (mm)",
    color = "Penguin species", shape = "Penguin species"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

By the way, did you know that 25 + 25 equals `r 25 + 25`? Pretty amazing, huh? Oh, and there are `r sum(penguins$Species == "Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua)")` penguins of the species Gentoo in the data set.
Another simple calculation (for R) is 3^16 , namely `r 3^16`. \\
\\
Next, we deal with the following function called "do_addition", which takes two numbers as input and prints the result.
```{r}
do_addition <- function(number1, number2){
  
  # Check that arguments provided are numberic
  if(class(number1) != "numeric" | class(number2) != "numeric"){
    print("Error: one or more of your inputs are not numeric")
    
    # Perform simple addition and return the result
  } else{
    result <- number1 + number2
    return(result)
  }
}
```

Let's test this, by calling 4 and 12 to the function "do_addition(4, 12)". `r do_addition(4, 12)` is the correct answer! It works!
