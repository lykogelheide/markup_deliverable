Unfortunately, I was not able to create a DOI, since there are currently some server issues with Zenodo (I linked my GitHub account to Zenodo, switched the toggle to ON for my repo, created a release, but no DOI was created. The following error occured: "error_id": "f4d8b42a97a84103afe62cf729b7d8d6", which according to some research means, that the server is currently overloaded and does not process my files).

I will try to create one in the next days and will add it if possible.
